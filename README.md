# Expo Image Component Remote Image Loading Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo `Image` component fails to load remote images due to problems with the image URL or the image server.  The example uses a placeholder image URL that may or may not be accessible, simulating the problem.  The solution provides a more robust approach to handling image loading failures.
