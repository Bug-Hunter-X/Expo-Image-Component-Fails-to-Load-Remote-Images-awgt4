This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a remote image URL that is not correctly formatted or accessible.  The image may fail to load, resulting in a blank space or an error message in the console.  This can happen due to issues with the URL, network connectivity, or the image server itself. For example, if the URL is misspelled, points to a non-existent image, or the server is down, the `Image` component won't be able to render it.
